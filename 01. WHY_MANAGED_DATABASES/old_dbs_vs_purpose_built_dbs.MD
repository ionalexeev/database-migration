# Fleeing old-guard databases

The world of databases has been a miserable place for most customers.

These customers have had to deal with old-guard database providers that are expensive, proprietary, have high lock-in, and impose punitive licensing terms.

Oracle & Microsoft decided changed their policy making it difficult to run on Cloud(AWS). Is it good for the ecosystem?

Because of the hostile practices of these old-guard database vendors, many customers are trying to move as fast as they can to open source databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB, and want them with the highest levels of performance and ease of operations.

# Why Purpose Built databases?

In the past decade, databases have evolved significantly.

Traditional applications such as ERP, CRM, and e-commerce mostly used relational databases because these applications mainly required recording transactions and storing structured data in GBs and occasionally TBs in size. But, approaches to building applications and application requirements themselves have changed.

Applications need to work with TBs and PBs of data, support millions of customers distributed globally, and process millions of requests per second with very low latency.

To support these needs, developers are increasingly building applications using microservice architectures and choosing relational and non-relational databases that are purpose-built to meet their application’s specific needs, like storing key-value pairs and documents.

For example, Lyft’s ride sharing application stores GPS coordinates to track millions of rides daily.

The data is simple, but is high volume, and needs to be accessed quickly by customers anywhere in the world.

In the new world of cloud-born applications, a one-size-fits-all database model no longer works.

Modern organizations are not only going to use multiple types of databases for multiple applications, but many are going to use multiple types of databases in a single application.

AWS offers the broadest range of purpose-built database services with relational and non-relational databases that are optimized for the most important use cases, allowing customers to deliver highly available, reliable, and performant user experiences.

AWS’s portfolio of purpose-built databases includes Relational (Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS), Key-Value (Amazon DynamoDB), Document (Amazon DocumentDB), In-Memory (Amazon ElastiCache), Graph (Amazon Neptune), Time-Series (Amazon Timestream), and Ledger (Amazon QLDB) databases to support a variety of application use cases.

These services are fully managed and allow you to build applications that scale easily. All of these services are battle-tested and provide deep functionality so you get the high availability, performance, reliability, and security required by production workloads.
